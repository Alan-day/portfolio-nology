        <p class=" about__paragraph1">
            I recently started my professional journey as a junior software engineer. After graduating university 
            in 2023 I enrolled on a fantastic course by _nology where I learnt about the application of the newest technologies. 
            This heavily project-based training allowed me to fully apply the knowledge gained during my studies.   
        </p>
        <p class=" about__paragraph2">
      What are you going to find on this page? The goal of this page is to show projects I did for _nology and for personal development. 
    The first project is a basic calculator developed in vanilla javascript and then as you move along the projects get more complex.
     During my time at university my interests revolved around cyber security of Internet of Things therefore at the bottom I included a brief overview of the research done for the purpose of my dissertation.

          As a junior developer who recently completed a bootcamp, where 
         I have gained proficiency in several technical skills. 
          Now I have some experience with Java, Spring Boot, React, JavaScript, Git, BEM, HTML, SASS, and CSS. 
          Additionally,I've completed a full stack project (currently working on another one) and done other smaller projects. 
          My skills include Java programming, building user interfaces with React, JavaScript development,
           version control with Git, adhering to BEM methodology for CSS, structuring HTML, utilizing 
           SASS for styling, and understanding full stack development concepts. 
           Overall, I am well-prepared to contribute to web development projects with my diverse skill set.

<h1 class="research__header">Research on IoT vulnerabilities</h1>


<p class="research__paragraph"> In 2022 I started my research on IoT devices and I 
  focused on network side of vulnerabilities (weak or lack of encrytpion, open network ports, no authentication and insufficient protocols). It is a common knowledge in IT community 
  that these devices are not safe. What makes them so prone to exploitation? 
  That was the question that made me start my research. Because of the overwhelming plethora of scientific papers
I decided to find few taxonomies of problems and narrow my examination to the network side of vulnerabilities.
<br><br>
  <p class="research__paragraph"> As an object of study, I chose the camera that was 
    relatively popular on the market (one of the first items that appeared on the list of popular 
    e-commerce websites) so I know that the specimen is relevant to research of others and findings 
    will apply to most devices of that type. After analysing the available materials, I realised that we
     have only few academic analyses in form of case studies of IoT cameras and that the threats and ways 
     of attacking said devices constantly evolves so my input in scientific research is an updated view on
      the network vulnerabilities and practical test of suggested methods that are based on taxonomy of several researchers. 
   
  </p>
  <br>
  





  <h1 class="research__header">Abstract</h1>
<p class="research__paragraph">Market for IoT devices grows larger year by year and more than 10 billions of devices is connected to the internet in 2022 with prospect of 
  doubling that figure by the end of the decade. Security issues have became a greater concern after recent DDoS attacks using IoT equipment for disrupting operation popular public services. 
  The purpose of this work was to explore network vulnerabilities of IoT devices to understand what problems exist in the field of IoT, evaluate security concerns and perform tests on a smart 
  camera to compare the results with previous scientists doing similar case study. There is a noticable progress in security measures applied to some types of IoT devices yet there are many 
  vulnerabilities that can be exploited and the field needs to be explored to a greater extent. I’m proposing few solutions like standarisation imposed by means of legislature and mandatory 
  testing done by the manufacturer notifying consumer of the possible vulnerabilities.   </p>

  <h1 class="research__header">Conclusions</h1>
<p class="research__paragraph">Over the years, network vulnerabilities have undergone slight transformations, yet they continue to pose significant threats, particularly in the realm of IoT devices. To effectively address these concerns, a more proactive approach through continuous testing and research is imperative, considering the inherent heterogeneity of these devices.

  Notably, progress has been made in the application of cryptography to enhance the security of smart cameras. However, to solidify this assertion, empirical data must be gathered to account for the diverse array of IoT devices in the market.
  <br><br>
  My research highlights the urgency for legislative authorities to step in and establish standardized security measures for these devices. By doing so, we can bolster the overall security landscape and provide users with a safer IoT experience. Additionally, it is crucial to inform users about potential weaknesses associated with these devices, empowering them to take proactive measures to safeguard their privacy and data.
  
  In conclusion, continuous efforts to identify and mitigate network vulnerabilities in IoT devices are essential to ensure a secure and trustworthy environment. Through a collaborative approach involving researchers, manufacturers, legislative bodies, and end-users, we can establish a robust framework that effectively safeguards the rapidly expanding IoT ecosystem.</p>
